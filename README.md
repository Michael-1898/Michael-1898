### About Me
<div>
  <p>
    I'm a highly motivated and diligent high school senior with a concentration in computer science and media production. Skilled in identifying and addressing conflicts in areas ranging from technical programming, project design, and team leadership and collaboration. I
    honed these skills over 3+ years of experience in programming and game development. My short term goal is to attend an Ai focused computer science program at a college or university to earn my  bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. My long term goal is to apply my
    energy and knowledge of computer science and Ai to solve the worldâ€™s most pressing issues such as climate change, energy sustainability, healthcare, or national security. Although I havenâ€™t yet decided which of these exact fields I will ultimately use my skills in,
    I am committed to making a meaningful impact in one of these areas.
